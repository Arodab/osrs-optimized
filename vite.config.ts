 * `base` must be identical for dev, build and preview. `vite preview` runs with

 * preview: the built index.html asks for /specscape/assets/... while the server
 * only serves /assets/..., and every asset falls through to the SPA fallback.
 *
 * Defaults to the GitHub Pages project-site path. For a root domain, build with
 * BASE=/ (in Git Bash use MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1, which otherwise rewrites a bare
 * "/" into a Windows path).
